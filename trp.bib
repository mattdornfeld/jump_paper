  abstract = {{ Adult rats produce two distinct types of ultrasonic vocalizations
	referred to as 22- and 50-kHz calls, respectively. Emission of the
	respective calls represents signaling a negative or positive state
	of the rat organism. The signaling has an adaptive value for survival
	and/or well-being of rats and their social groups. Literature is
	reviewed from studies on cats and rats, which indicates that the
	positive or negative states constitute a complex and integrated set
	of somatic, autonomic, endocrine, affective, and cognitive correlates.
	The basic states and their correlates are initiated, integrated,
	and maintained by activity of the subsets of the ascending cholinergic
	and dopaminergic systems originating from the reticular brainstem
	core. The cholinergic and dopaminergic systems interact mutually
	to form a dynamic balance, which is involved in a decision-making
	process of initiating and maintaining one or the other of these states.
	Activation of the relevant portion of the ascending cholinergic system
	invariably induces the negative state and releases 22-kHz calls while
	activation of the ascending dopaminergic system induces the positive
	state with 50-kHz calls. The 22- and 50-kHz calls have distinct and
	mostly non-overlapping acoustic parameters, which ensure unambiguous
	recognition of the calls and thus, the state of the emitter. The
	animal may only signal one of the states at any given time and emission
	of 22- or 50-kHz calls is mutually exclusive. It is postulated, therefore,
	that these two main types of ultrasonic calls are reliable indicator
	variables of two opposing states of the adult rat organism: negative
	or positive. }},

	particular attention to myology and neuromuscular structures to further
	validate it as a model to evaluate morphologic and functional changes
	induced by botulinum injection. A laryngeal alar cartilage (LAlC),
	alar cricoarytenoid (ACA) muscle, and a superior cricoarytenoid muscle
	(SCA) were identified as anatomic structures not previously described.
	Two portions (medial and lateral) of the thyroarytenoid muscle (TA)
	were distinguished. The function of the ACA was suggested to be similar
	to the aryepiglottis muscle in humans and the function of the SCA
	was suggested to be similar to the human interarytenoid muscle. The
	predominant pattern of motor endplate (MEP) distribution in rat laryngeal
	muscles (posterior cricoarytenoid, lateral cricoarytenoid, cricothyroid,
	and SCA) was to have MEPs concentrated mostly at the midbelly of
	muscle where they were distributed throughout the cross-sectional
	area of the midbelly. The TA and ACA differed from this pattern.
	The lateral TA had MEPs concentrated at the anterior third of its
	belly and those of the medial TA were located at the midbelly. Motor
	endplates in the ACA were located mostly at the posterior portion
	of muscle. Muscle fiber-typing showed subtle differences between

  abstract = {{Vocal production requires complex planning and coordination of respiratory,
	laryngeal and vocal tract movements, which are incompletely understood
	in most mammals. Rats produce a variety of whistles in the ultrasonic
	range which are of communicative relevance and of importance as model
	system, but the sources of acoustic variability were mostly unknown.
	The goal was to identify sources of fundamental frequency variability.
	Subglottal pressure, tracheal airflow and electromyographic data
	from two intrinsic laryngeal muscles measured during 22-kHz and 50-kHz
	call production in awake, spontaneously behaving adult male rats.
	During ultrasound vocalization, subglottal pressure ranged between
	0.8 and 1.9 kPa. Pressure differences between call types were not
	significant. The relation between fundamental frequency and subglottal
	pressure within call types was inconsistent. Experimental manipulations
	of subglottal pressure had only small effects on fundamental frequency.
	Tracheal airflow patterns were also inconsistently associated with
	frequency. Pressure and flow seem to play a small role in regulation
	of fundamental frequency. Muscle activity, however, is precisely
	regulated and very sensitive to alterations, presumably due to effects
	on resonance properties in the vocal tract. EMG activity of cricothyroid
	and thyroarytenoid muscle was tonic in calls with slow or no fundamental
	frequency modulations, like 22-kHz and flat 50-kHz calls. Both muscles
	showed brief high-amplitude, alternating bursts at rates up to 150
	Hz during production of frequency modulated 50-kHz calls. A differentiated
	and fine regulation of intrinsic laryngeal muscles is critical for
	normal ultrasound vocalization. Many features of the laryngeal muscle
	activation pattern during ultrasound vocalization in rats is shared

	by adult rats are heterogeneous; they occur over a wide frequency
	range, show varying degrees of frequency modulation, and appear to
	differ in their behavioral significance. However, they have not been
	extensively categorized. Objectives  The main objective of this study
	was to identify subtypes of 50-kHz USVs emitted by adult rats and
	to determine how amphetamine (AMPH) or social testing condition affects
	their relative and absolute production rate and acoustic characteristics.
	A second objective was to determine the extent of individual differences
	in call rate, call subtype profile, and acoustic parameters (i.e.,
	duration, bandwidth, and mean peak frequency). Methods  Adult male
	Long–Evans rats were administered systemic amphetamine (0.25–2 mg/kg,
	IP) and tested individually or with a cage mate for 20 min. Call
	categories were defined based on visual inspection of over 20,000
	USV spectrograms. Surgical devocalization was performed on a subset
	of AMPH-tested rats in order to confirm the authenticity of call
	subtypes. Results  Fourteen categories of 50-kHz USVs were recognized.
	Call subtypes were differentially affected by social context, AMPH
	dose, and time within session. In contrast, the acoustic characteristics
	of call subtypes were notably stable. Marked and stable inter-individual
	differences occurred with respect to overall 50-kHz call rate, acoustic
	parameters, and call profile. Conclusions  The present findings,
	obtained under saline and amphetamine test conditions, provide the
	first detailed classification of adult rat 50-kHz USVs. Consideration
	of 50-kHz USV subtypes may advance our understanding of inter-rat
	communication and affective state.}},
